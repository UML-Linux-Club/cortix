Cortix: Modeling and simulation made easy
=========================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
What is Cortix?
---------------
* Cortix is a Python library for system-level module coupling, execution, and
  analysis of dynamical system models that exchange time-dependent data.
* Cortix allows you to assemble a coupled system by connecting discrete
  `modules` into a `network` 
* Cortix takes as input a collection of computational modules and provides an 
  environment for the coupling of these modules into a single simulation.
